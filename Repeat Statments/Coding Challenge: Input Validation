Write a program that continues to ask the user for a number until the entered number is less than or equal to 50.

let number = Math.floor(Math.random()*100); // Generate the number
while (number > 50) {
  console.log(`${number} is not less than 50, try again!`);
  number = Math.floor(Math.random()*100);
}
  console.log(`Hooray! You got ${number}`);
