Write a program that plays “neither yes, nor no” with the user. Specifically, the program asks the user to enter text until either 'y'
′y′ or ′n′ is typed, which ends the game.

let input = "";
const alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"; 
  console.log(`Let's play "Neither y, nor n" ?`);
while (input !== "y" && input !== "n") {
  input=alphabet[Math.floor(Math.random() * alphabet.length)]; // Generate random character from define alphabet
  console.log(`Choosed character is ${input}`);
}
console.log("You just lost!");
