Let’s compute the square of every number between 0 and 10.

Writing 10 dumb calls to square() is forbidden! You know how to repeat statements, don’t you? ;)

// Square the given number x
// Square the given number x
function square(x) {
  return x*x;
}
// Call the above function repeatedly to print square of every number
// between 0 and 10

for(let i = 1; i < 10; i++){
  console.log(square(i));
}
